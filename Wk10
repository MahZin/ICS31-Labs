10.5 LAB: Word frequencies
###
Write a program that reads a list of words. Then, the program outputs those words and their frequencies.

Ex: If the input is:

hey hi Mark hi mark

Then, the output is:

hey 1
hi 2
Mark 1
hi 2
mark 1
###
def freq(str):

    str = str.split()
    str2 = []

    # loop till string values present in list str
    for i in str:

        # insert value in str2
        str2.append(i)

    for i in range(0, len(str2)):

        # count the frequency of each word present
        # in str2) in str and print
        print(str2[i], str.count(str2[i]))


def main():
    str = input()
    freq(str)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()



10.6 LAB: Contact list
###
A contact list is a place where you can store a specific contact with other associated information such as a phone number, 
email address, birthday, etc. Write a program that first takes in word pairs that consist of a name and a phone number (both strings). 
That list is followed by a name, and your program should output that name's phone number.

Ex: If the input is:

Joe 123-5432 Linda 983-4123 Frank 867-5309
Frank

the output is:

867-5309
###
s = input()
name = input()
splits = s.split(" ")
i = 0
for i in range(len(splits)):
    if(splits[i] == name):
        break
print(splits[i+1])



10.7 LAB: Replacement words
###
Write a program that replaces words in a sentence. The input begins with word replacement pairs (original and replacement). The next 
line of input is the sentence where any word on the original list is replaced.

Ex: If the input is:

automobile car   manufacturer maker   children kids
The automobile manufacturer recommends car seats for children if the automobile doesn't already have one.

then the output is:

The car maker recommends car seats for kids if the car doesn't already have one. 

You can assume the original words are unique.
###
# take user input for words that replace
s = input().split()
# take user input of the whole sentence
sentence = input()

# define a dictionary
d = dict()

# loop to create the dictionary
for i in range(0, len(s), 2):
    d[s[i]] = s[i + 1]

for x in d.keys():
    sentence = sentence.replace(x, d[x])

print(sentence)
